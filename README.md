# Syntalume Support

Public docs and support hub for **Syntalume — Adaptive Themes & Icons** (formerly Auralis), published under the Marketplace publisher ID `auralis-labs`.

> **Syntalume is the new name for Auralis** — same product, same themes, same listing, same update path. Existing installs upgrade in place. Current trial, subscription and appearance-recovery behavior is described below.

Syntalume is built for Terraform, Kubernetes/YAML, cloud infrastructure, React, Rust, AI-assisted work, code review, terminals, and long deep-work sessions.

## Install

Install from the official Visual Studio Marketplace listing:

- [Syntalume on the VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=auralis-labs.auralis-theme-system)
- [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/auralis-labs/auralis-theme-system)
- [Syntalume Theme on JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/32762-auralis-theme)
- Website: [syntalume.dev](https://syntalume.dev)

After installing, run:

```text
Syntalume: Open Setup Dashboard
```

For the fastest first run, choose:

```text
Syntalume: Apply Recommended Experience
```

## Subscriptions

New and existing users receive 30 days from the first presentation of the in-editor notice.
Closing the notice does not end that period.
Annual plans cost $9/$12/$20 USD for 1/3/6 editor-installation activations, plus
applicable tax. Checkout charges immediately and renews yearly until canceled.
Paid access requires online activation and periodic validation after consent.
Temporary connection/service failures retain previously verified access for up
to 72 hours, bounded by the known license expiry; confirmed revocation does not.
Browser-only extension hosts are outside
this paid release. See [licensing](https://syntalume.dev/legal/licensing),
[refunds](https://syntalume.dev/legal/refunds) and [privacy](PRIVACY.md).

## Help Test the Next Release

Syntalume (formerly Auralis) is inviting a small group of current users to test a private preview
for 7–14 days. There is no payment, purchase, or expectation of a positive
review. We want candid feedback from people who will actually use the preview
in their normal editor workflow.

[Volunteer for the private preview](https://github.com/syntalume/syntalume-support/issues/new?template=private_preview.yml)

The application is a public GitHub issue, so do not include an email address,
private code, project details, or other personal information. Selected testers
will be notified on their issue and invited to a private GitHub space. Read the
[private-preview guide](docs/private-preview.md) before volunteering.

## Terminal Ports

Generated terminal palettes for every Syntalume theme — iTerm2, Windows
Terminal, Alacritty, WezTerm, Ghostty, and Warp — live in [ports/](ports/).
Inside VS Code, `Syntalume: Export Terminal Theme` produces the same files.
Porting Syntalume to another app? Palettes: [ports/palettes.json](ports/palettes.json)
— guide: [docs/porting.md](docs/porting.md).

For Shiki, documentation tooling, and verified community ports, the generated
public package source is available at [packages/auralis-palettes/](packages/auralis-palettes/).
It is not yet published to npm; its first release will be announced here and
published with npm trusted-publisher provenance.

## Support

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/syntalume/syntalume-support/issues) for bugs, install problems, docs issues, and feature requests.
- Include your Syntalume version, VS Code version, operating system, active theme/profile, and the output of `Syntalume: Doctor` when useful.

## Source Boundary

The Syntalume product source is private. This repository is public so users have a reliable docs, schemas, generated palette data, and support surface. A public palette package and contribution kit make cross-tool ports independently verifiable without exposing proprietary runtime source.

## Security And Privacy

Syntalume uses a small lazy runtime after startup and has no passive telemetry. Paid licenses are periodically verified with Polar in the background after activation consent; licensing never uploads project contents, paths or settings. Optional local features run only after a Syntalume command/profile enables them.
