# Performance and Privacy

Syntalume is designed around explicit budgets and local work, not an absolute
"no startup cost" promise.

## Performance

- Color themes, file icons, and product icons load declaratively with no code execution.
- The small runtime activates lazily at `onStartupFinished`, after VS Code's
  own startup path. It registers commands but claims no idle status-bar space;
  the single optional Syntalume entry exists only while Environment Guard or a
  Review Session has state to show. Enabled optional tools then initialize
  only the work they need.
- Desktop and browser entry points record the duration of the actual
  `activate()` registration path. Desktop also records its non-negative heap
  delta. Integration QA reads those in-memory measurements for release-budget
  assertions; they contain no workspace or user data and are never sent.
- Release gates cap the generated desktop bundle at 340 KiB and the browser
  bundle at 302 KiB. Separate desktop-only YAML and file-lock helpers are
  capped at 140 KiB and 24 KiB and load only when their features need them. The browser ceiling includes the same bounded,
  fail-closed exact-reset safety checks as desktop. The real VS Code
  integration suite budgets extension
  activation below 2 seconds and activation heap growth below 32 MiB on the CI
  runner. These are ceilings, not claims that every machine has identical
  timings.
- Representative theme, icon, language, diff, terminal, and JetBrains resource
  outputs have deterministic visual baselines; changing one requires an
  explicit baseline update.
- Enabled ambience survives a restart instead of resetting each session.
- Tooling setup commands only write VS Code settings and optionally open/install companion extensions after user confirmation.
- Focus Field decorates visible ranges only.
- Edit Heatmap caps files, lines, and age.
- Blame Ghosts debounces cursor movement and caches results.

## Privacy

- No telemetry.
- Paid licenses are periodically verified with Polar in the background; project data is not sent.
- Trial use is checked locally. Paid access requires online activation and
  periodic validation after consent. A previously verified license can continue
  for up to 72 hours during temporary connection/service failures, bounded by
  its known expiry. Confirmed revocation does not receive this grace. See
  [Privacy](https://syntalume.dev/legal/privacy).
- No secret scanning.
- No source upload.
- No passive review or feedback prompts. Support links run only when you choose
  them and let you inspect the copied or prefilled payload before submitting.
- The optional JetBrains Companion reads `.syntalume/profile.json` first, with
  `.auralis/profile.json` as a legacy fallback, only when you inspect or apply it. Accepted appearance values are stored in normal local
  IDE/project component state and a locally derived editor scheme; no project
  file is edited and project metadata is not transmitted. Licensing requests are handled separately
  by the standalone Theme’s licensing service. Exact reset fingerprints public
  scheme settings so later manual edits are preserved.
- The Setup Dashboard can show two aggregate activity counts: explicit Tune
  applies and shared profile recommendations you chose to apply. They contain
  no timestamps, project names, paths, or settings; they stay in this VS Code
  installation's local extension storage, are never transmitted, and can be
  cleared from the dashboard at any time.
- Blame Ghosts runs local `git blame` only when enabled by the user and only in trusted local workspaces. `restrictedConfigurations` keeps the blame settings from taking effect until the workspace is trusted.
- Syntalume Doctor only checks whether optional companion CLIs are available on `PATH`, and only in trusted workspaces; it does not run formatters or linters against your source files.
- The Setup Dashboard webview is locked down: a crypto-strong per-render nonce, `localResourceRoots: []`, `retainContextWhenHidden: false`, and a `default-src 'none'` Content-Security-Policy. It loads no external or local resources.
- Accessibility Lab uses a locked-down, local-resource-free webview. Icon
  Studio's equally locked-down webview can read only Syntalume's packaged icon
  directory so it can render its inventory; it cannot read workspace files.
  On desktop, Apply rewrites only the bounded contributed Studio manifest and
  SVG directory inside the installed extension. Presets and reports stay local
  until you explicitly copy or save them.
- License keys use editor secret storage and the provider's activation identifiers.
  Trial timing uses a durable record and secure-store backup. See the full
  [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/syntalume/syntalume-support/blob/main/PRIVACY.md).
- Activation metrics separate licensing work from feature startup and retain
  total elapsed time. The trial notice does not block editor startup.

## Supported execution environments

The paid release supports native VS Code-compatible extension hosts, including
supported server-based hosts, and JetBrains. Browser-only extension hosts such
as vscode.dev/github.dev are excluded until shared browser licensing is ready.
Remote native hosts need persistent writable storage and may consume a separate
activation. Virtual workspaces still omit features that need local files or tools.
